# Trabajo_Integrador_UTN

This is the website I made at the UTN online course "Fullstack web development with ReactJS diploma"
The project is divided in two folders, the front-end one and the back-end one.

The first folder has my page, wich was done with create-react-app.
It has six sections you can navigate from the navbar, one of them showing data from the database and other one for contact (sending forms to my maitrap account).

The second folder is other page built with NodeJS, Express and handlebars.
Here you can log in to watch, add, modify and delete "orders" (text and a image).

Since runing this project on your pc would take you some time...
(you have to download wampserver, import my database, then run the backend and later the frontend from the terminal and finally open the pages on localhost ports 3000 and 3001)
...I'll be leaving here a link to the video showing how it works on my google drive :)
